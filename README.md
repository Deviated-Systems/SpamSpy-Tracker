Tracker for issues specific to SpamSpy and its API. If you have a general issue or non-integration-specific feature request please go to https://discord.gg/nDw5HbKt
## Conduct
There are basic rules of conduct that should be followed at all times by everyone participating in the discussions. While this is generally a relaxed environment, please remember the following:

- Do not insult, harass, or demean anyone.
- Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.
- Do not use ALL CAPS when creating an issue report.
- Do not repeatedly update an open issue remarking that the issue persists.
---
###### Remember:

Just because the issue you reported was reported here does not mean that it is an issue with SpamSpy. As well, should your issue not be resolved immediately, it does not mean that a resolution is not being researched or tested. Patience is always appreciated.

Reporting Issues
----------------

If you encounter a bug while using SpamSpy, first search the [issue list](https://github.com/Deviated-Systems/SpamSpy-Tracker/issues) to see if it has already been reported. Include closed issues in your search. If your issue has been reported, please upvote the issue by clicking the "Add Reaction" button (smiley face with a plus sign) on the top post and adding a thumbs up. Voting helps us determine which issues are important to users without cluttering the bug database.

Note: Comments do not count as votes.

If it has not been reported, create a new issue with at least the following information:

- what platform this is occurring on: *(eg: Zapier or RapidAPI)*;
- a short, descriptive title;
- a detailed description of the issue, including any output from the command line;
- steps for reproducing the issue

Please place logs either in a code block (press `M` in your browser for a GFM cheat sheet) or a [gist](https://gist.github.com).
